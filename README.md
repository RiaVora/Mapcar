# Mapcar

PURPOSE: 
This code was partially serviced from numerous websites, and partially created by myself to learn more about creating a method accessible
to many Objects, and creating functions in arguments.

OVERVIEW: 
Mapcar takes a function and a list, and implements that function on that list.

EXPLANATION: 
For example, if you want to square each n in a list of 6 integers, you pass mapcar the square function and the list of integers
(1, 2, 3) --> (1, 4, 9)
To see MapCar work, run the code on an IDE to see an explanation in the console.

PARALLELS: 
This is exactly the same thing as a for-each method, but written more concisely.
